## Running Locally

To launch the project, you need to start the frontend and, optionally, the backend.

### Frontend

The simplest way to start the frontend is to open the [index.html](https://github.com/Red-Pill-TSI/red-pill-cryptocurrency/blob/main/frontend/static/index.html)
file directly in your web browser of choice. Alternatively, you may start an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server by executing the following commands from the
`frontend` directory, assuming you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

The website should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Backend

To run the backend, you need to have a local intallation of the Python interpreter. From the `backend` directory, you
must first ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies installed:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you may start up the backend server itself using the following command:

```sh
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The server should be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. For information about endpoints, refer to the [OpenAPI
specification](https://github.com/Red-Pill-TSI/red-pill-cryptocurrency/blob/main/docs/red-pill-cryptocurrency-1.0.0.yaml)
under `docs`.
